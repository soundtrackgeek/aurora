# Changelog

All notable Aurora changes are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Direct half-star and full-star hit areas on every Explore row, plus a directly clickable Love control.
- Per-track saving, pending-import, and conflict feedback for immediate MP3 tag writes.

### Changed

- Explore rating and Love clicks now save and verify through the existing safe MP3 writer immediately, without requiring the inspector's Save to MP3 button.
- Inline edits update optimistically, prevent overlapping writes to the same track, reconcile the inspector after confirmation, and roll back the row if the native save fails.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- MusicBee-compatible MP3 editing for half-star rating, Love/Neutral/Ban, and Release Year.
- Durable tag-operation journal, same-folder working copies, retained rollback backups, startup crash recovery, and one-step verified undo.
- Aurora-owned tag overlay that reflects file edits immediately and reconciles after a later MusicBee TSV import.
- Stable normalized-path track identity for restoring playback queues across Music Library imports that replace integer track IDs.
- Recovery coverage for the crash window immediately after atomic replacement and before its journal checkpoint.
- Recovery for Windows `ReplaceFileW` partial-failure states where the original has moved to Aurora's backup but the canonical MP3 path is temporarily absent.
- Conservative conflict recovery that only completes a known Aurora file state and retains every copy instead of overwriting an ambiguous external edit.
- Browser-preview coverage for save, undo, half-stars, and stale-edit conflicts.

### Changed

- The inspector now reads current tags from the selected MP3 and exposes a compact metadata editor.
- Rating display and editing support MusicBee's complete 0.5–5.0 scale.
- Aurora state schema advances to version 4 for stable queue references, tag overlays, save history, and crash-recoverable undo.
- Half-star catalog reads fall back to validated `rating_raw` values when Music Library leaves `normalized_rating` empty.
- Queue restoration preserves surviving entries when individual files have disappeared, and tag refreshes no longer reset filtered selection.

### Security

- Rust resolves every edit target from a bounded catalog ID; React cannot submit an arbitrary file path.
- Writes preserve the existing ID3 version, non-target frames, ID3v1/trailing bytes, and MP3 audio payload.
- Aurora verifies path identity, size, timestamps, target frames, preserved frames, and audio hash around atomic `ReplaceFileW` replacement.
- Native play and tag commands require both the transient catalog ID and stable path key; Windows blocks concurrent writers during the final check and replacement.
- Undo refuses to replace a file when any unrelated ID3 frame, ID3v1/trailing byte, or audio byte changed after Aurora's edit.
- The shared Music Library catalog remains enforced read-only; only Aurora's private SQLite state and explicitly saved MP3 tags are writable.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Native MP3 playback with play/pause, seek, previous/next, volume, shuffle, repeat-all, and repeat-one controls.
- Durable, bounded listening queue with play-now, reorder, remove, and clear actions.
- Aurora-owned SQLite state for queue order, current item, position, volume, shuffle, and repeat state across restarts.
- Contained `aurora-cover` protocol with exact album-ID resolution and cached 64–512 px WebP thumbnails.
- Browser-preview playback simulator and interaction coverage for transport and queue behavior.

### Changed

- Project testing guidance now prefers Browser-based UI inspection and limits Computer Use to native-only behavior that Browser cannot exercise.
- Track rows and the inspector now expose direct play actions; the persistent footer is a functional player.

### Security

- Playback accepts bounded catalog track IDs and re-resolves file paths in Rust; the WebView cannot request arbitrary files.
- Album art is canonicalized beneath the configured archive and source images above 32 MiB are rejected.
- The imported catalog and audio metadata remain read-only; file-tag editing is not part of 0.2.0.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Tauri 2 Windows application scaffold with a React and TypeScript interface based on the supplied Aurora design.
- Read-only SQLite overview, top-artist universe, artist drill-down, and bounded five-star track page for the existing music catalog.
- Safely quoted FTS5 prefix search across the complete catalog with stale-request protection in the interface.
- Read-only track inspector that distinguishes MusicBee rating, Love, Release Year, and Last.fm popularity.
- Aurora application icon, keyboard search shortcut, reduced-motion handling, loading, empty, and source-error states.
- Signed Tauri updater checks at startup and every minute with in-app download/install progress.
- Pinned GitHub Actions CI and Windows NSIS release workflows, aligned-version validation, and updater signing secrets.
- Verified database, 98.09%-coverage album-art, and MusicBee tag contracts for the next cover, playback, and metadata-writing sections.

### Security

- The source catalog opens with SQLite read-only flags and `query_only`; Aurora does not modify the live catalog or audio files in this release.
- Release workflow actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs and updater private material is kept outside source control.
